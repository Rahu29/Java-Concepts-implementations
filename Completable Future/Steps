1) Make a instance of CompletableFuture.
2) Assign a task and write a logic like thread with the help of supplyAsync(It return's a result) functional inteface.
3) At last return whatever the result you want (The return type of completable future is GENERIC).
4) Use Other methods as per requirements -
    1) .thenApply() -
        1) Used to transform or perform some sort of task on previous output.
        2) It takes the input and return new input.
        3) Mostly used when we want to modeify data.
        4) Return type --> Generic (CompletableFuture<U>).

    2) .thenAccept() -
        1) Consumes the result and does not return any value.
        2) Used for Logging/Printing/Saving the results.
        3) Return type --> void

    3) .thenRun() -
        1) It is running after completion of CompletableFuture.
        2) It will not read the result returned by the Completable future.
        3) Used for non-dependable task on output like sent notification/mail after completing certain task.
        4) Return type --> void

    4) .thenCompose() -
        1) Used for dependent async calls.
        2) Used to flattened nested futures.
        3) Return type --> Generic (CompletableFuture<U>).
